# WooCommerce One Page Checkout - Do Not Empty Cart

Using [WooCommerce One Page Checkout](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-one-page-checkout/)?

By default, One Page Checkout will empty the cart for [product selection](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-one-page-checkout/#section-15) via radio elements or Easy Pricing Tables.
